# Simple-Reminder-Application

The Simple Reminder Application is a Python-based desktop application designed to help users manage their daily activities efficiently. The application offers a user-friendly interface with dropdown menus for selecting the day of the week, the time, and the activity to be reminded of.

Features:

Day Selection Dropdown: Users can choose the day of the week for which they want to set reminders. The dropdown provides options for all seven days of the week.

Time Selection Dropdown: Users can select the time at which they want to be reminded of their activities. The time is displayed in a standard 12-hour format with options for AM and PM.

Activity Selection Dropdown: Users can select from a predefined list of activities that they want to be reminded of. The list includes common daily activities such as waking up, going to the gym, having breakfast, attending meetings, lunchtime, taking a quick nap, visiting the library, having dinner, and going to sleep.

Set Reminder Button: Once the user has selected the desired day, time, and activity, they can click the "Set Reminder" button to confirm their selection. The application will then continuously monitor the system time and trigger a reminder with a sound notification when the selected time matches the current time.

Implementation:

The application is built using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and the pygame library for playing sound notifications. Tkinter provides an easy-to-use interface for creating dropdown menus, labels, and buttons, making it suitable for simple desktop applications. Pygame is utilized to play sound notifications when a reminder is triggered.

Usage:

Select the activity to be reminded of from the dropdown menu. Click the "Set Reminder" button to confirm your selection. The application will continuously monitor the system time and trigger a reminder with a sound notification when the selected time matches the current time. Purpose:
